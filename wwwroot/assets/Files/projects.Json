    "Description": "<p><b>Presentation:</b> Alcohol Minimum Pricing and Subsidies – Market Impacts and Policy Analysis
This presentation explores two key public policy tools: minimum alcohol pricing and government subsidies. It examines the economic impact of alcohol pricing on market equilibrium, elasticity, consumer welfare, and potential unintended consequences, using real-world examples like Scotland’s pricing policy. The second part analyzes the effects of subsidies, both in the absence and presence of externalities, highlighting cases where subsidies can lead to deadweight loss or enhance welfare—such as in vaccination programs. The content is grounded in economic theory with visual aids and practical illustrations.</p>",
